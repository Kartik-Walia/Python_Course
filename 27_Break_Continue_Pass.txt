continue -> Skips that particular iteration
break -> Break that loop, won't conitnue with loop

def fun():
    print("do something")
If you just want to declare a function but i don't know the content inside of it or maybe i increment 
it later on, in such a scenario you can simply say pass
def fun():
    pass 
By above code you're saying to python compiler that 
Hey, i'm simply using this function but i don't know how to implement it, so skip this function
If you want to keep a function empty, you'll use pass
Same goes for empty if condition
Same goes for class also
Whenever you've a suite (like if, function) & you don't know what we'll have in block, use pass 

We normally use continue or break statements in a function or in a loop
But when it comes to pass, we normally sue it to skip the block (to define a empty block)
