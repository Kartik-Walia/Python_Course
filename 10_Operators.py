# OPERATORS :
# 1. Arithmetic Operators :
#     +
#     -
#     *
#     /
# 2. Assignment Operators :
#     =
#     Shortcuts
#     -> x = x + a <=> x += a
#     -> x = x - a <=> x -= a
#     -> x = x * a <=> x *= a
#     -> x = x / a <=> x /= a

#     Assignment can be done in 1 line
#     a,b = 5,6
# 3. Relational Operators : (Returns True or False)
#     > (greater than)
#     < (less than)
#     == (equal to)
#     <= (greater than or equal to)
#     >= (less than or equal to)
#     != (Not equal to)
# 4. Logical Operators :
#     and
#     or
#     not 
# 5. Unary Operator :
#     n = 7
#     n = -n # This makes n = -7
