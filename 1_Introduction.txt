Python always gives division result in float datatype
Integer division (or Floor division) // 
** -> exponenetial power
% -> remainder

print('navin's laptop') -> throws error!
print("navin's laptop") -> doesn't throws error!
print('navin "laptop"') -> when to print laptop in ""
print('navin's "laptop"') -> throws error
print('navin\'s "laptop"') -> doesn't throw error (\ tells compiler to ignore meaning of ')
10*'navin' -> string gets printed 10 times without gap
\n -> newline character
print('c:/navin') -> \n works as it is supposed to
print(r'c:/navin') -> r means raw string, so \n doesnt works as newline character
