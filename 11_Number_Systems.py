# NUMBER SYSTEMS :
# 1. Binary :
#     base 2 -> 0-1 (2 digits)
# 2. Decimal :
#     base 10 -> 0-9 (10 digits)
# 3. Octal :
#     base 8 -> 0-7 (8 digits)`
# 4. HexaDecimal :
#     base 16 -> 0-9 a-f (16 digits)

# bin() -> used to convert a number from decimal system to binary system 
print(bin(25)) # -> gives 0b11001, here 0b represents that number is in binary format 

# oct() -> used to convert a number from decimal system to octal system 
print(oct(25)) # -> gives 0o31, here 0o represents that number is in octal format 

# hex() -> used to convert a number from decimal system to hexadecimal system 
print(hex(25)) # -> gives 0x19, here 0x represents that number is in hexadecimal format 
print(0xf) # -> gives 15 , example to show that reverse can also work
