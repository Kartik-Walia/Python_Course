To repeat same set of statements without re-writing them, we use Loops

TYPES OF LOOPS:
1. while loop
    For certain iterations & for certain conditions
    We specify a condition
2. for loop
    It normally works with sequence(list, tuple, string, etc.)
    Unlike while loop :
    a   We don't initialize variable
    b   We don't check condition
    c   We don't increment/decrement by ourselves (it would be done by for loop itself)
