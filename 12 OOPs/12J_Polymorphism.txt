When we talk about Polymorphism, it's breaked into words 'Poly' & 'Morphism'
Poly means 'many' & Morph means 'form'
So, that means one thing can take multiple forms 
Eg: Us humans are Polymorphic, we behave differentlty in different surroundings
In the same way, when you talk about Object Oriented, Objects will have multiple forms 
So, this concept is very important when you talk about Software Development
So, we use this concept alot when it comes to Loose Coupling, Dependency Injection
We also have a concept of interfaces which we'll see later 

THE 4 WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING POLYMORPHISM:
1. Duck Typing
2. Operator Overloading 
3. Method Overloading
4. Method Overriding

So, Polymorphism is basically 1 thing with multiple forms
