METHOD OVERLOADING :
It simply means if you've a class and in that class you've 2 method with the same name but different parameters
or arguments it is called as "Method Overloading"
Eg: In a class Student, we've 2 methodswith same name, let's say average, one takes 2 parameters & other takes 
    3 parameters
But in pythong, we don't have this concept, so we cannot create 2 methods with the same name

METHOD OVERRIDING :
It simply means you've 2 methods with the same name & same number of parameters or arguments, so that means 
can we create 2 methods with same name and same parameter in a same class. 
Ofcourse not! Not in a same class, but let's say you've a concept of inheritance. We've class A and class B,
and both the class have the same method with same name and same parameter, this is called as "Overriding"
