CPU has basically 3 parts :
1. CU (Control Unit)
2. MU (Memory Unit)
    Stores variables & data
3. ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit)
    Arithmetic unit performs calculations
    Logic unit performs thinking of computer

This thinking of computer is basically decided by if statements (tells us about the flow of execution)
