TYPES OF ARRAYS:
1. Single Dimensional Array (1D-Array)
    Row format
2. Multi Dimensional Array (2D-Array, 3D-array)
    2D-Array -> Matrix format
    3D-Array -> Cube format


In Array available in Python,  you cannot work with multi-dimensional array unfortunately
from array import *
arr = array('i', [1,2,3],[4,5,6]) # Each [] represents 1 row 
# Above code will throw an error! 
Thatswhy where the use of 3rd party package comes in -> Numpy

Numpy is not installed by default, we need to install it first by below command:
pip3 install numpy

SYNTAX FOR NUMPY ARRAY DECLARATION :
arr = array([values], data_type)
# We don't write TypeCodes while array declaration in numpy
