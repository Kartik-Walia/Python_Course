Earlier we've talked about iterators so normally we use iterators to print or to fetch 1 value 
at a time, say if u've list of values and if u want 1 by 1 value what makes sense is to use an
iterator, but there are small issues with iterators, the 1st one you need to get the iterator 
where you have to define those 2 functions next and iter. We don't wanna do it, we want Python 
to do it for us & that's where Python says okay if u want iterators we will give you generators


We not exactly have 2 different concepts 
Generators will give you iterators, our job is done!

BUT HOW EXACTLY TO CREATE A GENERATOR ?


WHY SOMEONE WILL USE GENERATOR?
Let's say you're fetching 1000 records from a database, so when you say you're fetching 1000
records maybe you want to print all or you want to process soemthing from those records.
So, when you say you want to fetch 1000 records, all this 1000 records will be lowering your
memory, we don't want that. Maybe you want to work with 1 value at a time. In that case, you can
use generator instead of fetching the entire list, you can fetch 1 by 1 value, so that's 
something you can do with generator
