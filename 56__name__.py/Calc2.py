import Demo2

print("It's time to calculate")

# Since, Calc2 is my first code here, so i'm not runnning Demo2, i'm running Calc2, so Demo2 becomes a 
# module for me, a separate module 

# The moment i run Calc2, it is also printing "Hello" & "Welcome user", but i don't wanna do that
# So, to avoid that what you can do is 
# You can define it in a function & put those 2 print staements inside that function
