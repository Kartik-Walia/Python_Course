If debugging is removing bugs, then coding is adding new bugs 

Instead of writing 1 big software in 1 file, we break it down into small parts  

ADVANTAGES OF BREAKING DOWN INTO MODULES :
1. If you want to change something in a module,it won't affect the other modules
2. You can also resuse your modules in other projects as well


# I want to peform all mathematical operations on 2 numbers
# Either you can create 4 functions in this same module or you can create a separate module for all 
# 4 functions

# That makes more sense making a separate module
